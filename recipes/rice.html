    <h2>Description of the Recipe</h2>
    <p>The dish centers on a fragrant rice base made from long-grain rice that has been cooked and stir-fried with
        finely chopped vegetables such as carrots, green peas, sweet corn, and green beans. Its warm yellow-gold hue
        points to the use of curry powder or turmeric, hallmarks of West African–style fried rice. The rice is further
        enriched with aromatic seasonings—garlic, onions, curry, thyme, and possibly stock or seasoning cubes—resulting
        in a deeply savory, well-rounded flavor profile.</p>
    <p>Complementing the rice are generous pieces of chicken, most likely thighs or quarters, that have been carefully
        marinated and then roasted or grilled until well browned. The cooking method produces a crisp, flavorful
        exterior while preserving a juicy, tender interior. A light garnish of fresh herbs, such as mint or parsley,
        crowns the dish, adding a fresh aroma and a touch of visual brightness that balances the richness of the meal.
